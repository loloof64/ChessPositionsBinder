        <p>
            This page is used to inform you regarding the policies with the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for the app, Chess Posiitions Binder. 
            Laurent Bernabe respect the privacy of users and is committed to protect the user's information, be it yours or your children's. 
            I believe that you have a right to know my practices regarding the information I may collect and use when you use my app.
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy of my product users is important to me. I do not collect any identifiable information about my users. I do not store or transmit any personal information.
            Even the use of Dropbox is respectful regarding your privacy : the session is only stored using a Bearer Token, which avoid the need to store user id and password.
            Also the Dropbox profile data is not stored in any way on the device : it is just accessed by the API on demand.
        </p>

            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy please contact me at laurent.bernabe@gmail.com.
